<!-- display property -->
<!-- The display property in CSS determines how an element is rendered on the page. The three common values for the display property are inline, block, and inline-block -->

<!-- inline: -->
<!-- Behavior:
Does not break to a new line.
Ignores width and height properties.
Only padding, margin, and border can be applied horizontally, not vertically. -->

<!-- block -->
<!-- Starts on a new line.
Takes up the full width of its container unless a specific width is set.
Allows setting width, height, margin, and padding on all sides. -->

<!-- inline block -->
<!-- Behavior:
Does not break to a new line (sits inline with other elements).
Allows setting width, height, margin, and padding on all sides. -->


<!-- box model -->
<!-- The CSS box model describes how elements on a web page are structured and how their dimensions (width and height) are calculated. It includes the content of the element, its padding, border, and margin. Understanding the box model is crucial for layout and positioning in web design. -->

<!-- Box-Sizing Property:
You can use the box-sizing property to change how the box model is calculated. -->


<!-- 
static	Default position. Follows normal document flow.
relative	Positioned relative to its normal position without affecting the flow of other elements.
absolute	Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. Removed from the normal flow.
fixed	Positioned relative to the viewport. Stays in place even when scrolling.
sticky	Acts like relative until a certain point, then becomes fixed in its container.
